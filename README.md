## First_robot_project_with_ROS
first project of robot project which is mainly slam based on ROS during 2021.12.21 ~ 12.27 at RAPA in Seoul mokdong  

# Our member's tasks  
Lee sang chul : supervise the entire process, devise related algorithm and circumvent difficulties of implementation.  
Kim bong jin : implement almost algorithm and simulation configurations.  
Kim chang sun : suggest tema goal, write project plan, and discuss algorithms.  

# algorithm architecture

# difficulties of project process
 <ul>
  <li>knowlege absence of deep ROS structures</li>
  <li>wandering how to configure gazebo urdf and sdf files</li>
  <li>shallow knowledge of physics</li>
</ul> 

#exclamation points of members
Lee sang chul : this project gave me the deep architure of ROS, but this is common project, so the answers were poor mostly. 
Kim bong jin : ROS? 아직 멀었다.
kim chang sun : ROS의 세계
